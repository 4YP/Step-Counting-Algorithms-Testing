# Step counter algorithm python testing framework

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Windowed Peak Detection step counter algorithm with all its variations.

The algorithm is wrapped in a client/server architecture that allows running multiple instances of the algorithm with different sets of parameters.
The orchestrator is available in the orchestrator folder.
